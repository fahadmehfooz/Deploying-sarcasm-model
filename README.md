# Sarcastic-Or-Not-Deployment-With-Bidirectional-LSTM-CNN-LogisticRegression

* Classifying different comments to whether they are Sarcasic or not.
* Dataset has 1010773 rows.
* There was no imbalance in data.
* Took a test split of 20%.
* Converting the tokens using a TF-IDF vectorizer.
* Also, creating a word embedding for CNN/BiDirectional LSTM model.
* Performed EDA on the features.
* Models trained with BiDirectional, CNN, and Logistic Regression.
* Created an app on Flask and deployed it on Heroku.


## Languages Used 
**Python Version:** 3.9.0

## Resources and Tools Used
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

**Packages:** Pandas, NumPy, sklearn, nltk, string, WordCloud, tensorflow and seaborn.  

## Data Used
* This dataset contains 1.3 million Sarcastic comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit (not by me :)) containing the \s ( sarcasm) tag. 
* This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.
* **Data taken from kaggle** : https://www.kaggle.com/fahadmehfoooz/saracsm-eda-bidirectional-cnn-logistic-deployment/data

## Data Wrangling and Data Visualization
* Removing rows with null values.
* Replacing certain characters with with ',' and also lowercasing the words.
* Preparing the comments by removing the stopwords, punctuations and converting it to cleaned text.
* Creating text features using Tf-IDF vectorizer for Logistic Regression model.
* For Bidirectional LSTM/Cnn, preparing a corpus, doing a word embedding and then fitting the model on that.
* Doing a train test split.

## Model Building 

First, I took a split on the data with training data as 80%. I tried to compare all the models listed down.

Models Used:

* CNN
* Logistic Regression
* Bidirectional LSTM

## Model performance

**Results:**

**Bidirectional LSTM is performing better here, although not by a great margin.**
